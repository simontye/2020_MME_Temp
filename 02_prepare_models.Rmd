### Step 1: Load packages and data

This is a second pass at data processing to prepare data for model fitting.

```{r: Load packages and data}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

# Set working directory
setwd("/Users/simontye/Documents/Research/Projects/MME_Temp/2020_MME_Temp/data/processed")

# Re-process data. Need to add in air temperature data
model_data_monthly <- read_csv("model_data_monthly.csv",
                            col_types = list(site_id = col_character(),
                                             year = col_character(),
                                             month  = col_character(),
                                             season = col_character(),
                                             summerkill = col_character(),
                                             ice_duration = col_double())) %>%
  select(-cause.category.4, -anthropogenic, -infectious, -unknown, -winterkill) %>%
  mutate(summerkill = fct_recode(summerkill,
                                 "neg" = "0",
                                 "pos" = "1"))
```

### Step 2: Partition and scale data

The two primary steps carried out here is to partition the
data into training and testing sets and to scale them to allow for coefficient comparison.

```{r: Partition and scale data}
# Set seed
set.seed(998)
in_training <- createDataPartition(model_data_monthly$summerkill, p = .75, list = FALSE)

# Partition data
training <- model_data_monthly  %>%
  slice(in_training)
testing  <- model_data_monthly %>%
  slice(-in_training)

# Scale data
pre_proc_values <- preProcess(training, method = c("center", "scale"))
training <- predict(pre_proc_values, training) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
testing  <- predict(pre_proc_values, testing) %>%
  mutate(summerkill = factor(testing$summerkill, 
                             levels = c("pos", "neg"), 
                             ordered = TRUE),
         year = as.integer(year))

# Export data
write_csv(training, "../prepared_for_modeling/training.csv")
write_csv(testing, "../prepared_for_modeling/testing.csv")
   bbbbbb
   \]]]
```

### Step 3: In progress
