### Background

Models are fit to the training data from `02_prepare_models` via four primary model families listed below. This is the same workflow as Till et al. (2019) except that I switched the file conversion from tibble to dataframe because of parsing errors.

1. Logistic regression
2. Ridge regression
3. Lasso regression
4. Logistic regression with random effects

### Step 1: Load packages and data

```{r: Load packages and data}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rsample)
library(caret)
library(glmnet)
library(Matrix)
library(e1071)
library(pROC)
library(PRROC) 
library(glmnetUtils)
library(doParallel)
library(lme4)
library(optimx)

# Reset global environment
rm(list = ls())

# Set working directory
setwd("/Users/simontye/Documents/Research/Projects/MME_Temp/2020_MME_Temp/data/models")

# Load data
training <- read.csv(file = "training.csv", head = TRUE, sep = ",")
testing  <- read.csv(file = "testing.csv",  head = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Reformat training data
training <- training %>%
  mutate(site_id      = as.character(site_id),
         year         = as.character(year),
         month        = as.character(month),
         season       = as.character(season),
         summerkill   = as.factor(summerkill),
         ice_duration = as.double(ice_duration))

# Reformat testing data
testing <- testing %>%
  mutate(site_id      = as.character(site_id),
         year         = as.character(year),
         month        = as.character(month),
         season       = as.character(season),
         summerkill   = as.factor(summerkill),
         ice_duration = as.double(ice_duration))
```

### Step 2: Specify variable sets

The first generalized model uses a subset of variables selected based on their presumed effect and not being mutually non-correlated (at least strongly). Throughout the remaining code, models that are based on air or water temperature begin with "a" or "w", respectively.

```{r: First generalized model}
# First generalized model for water temperature (removed population for now because of NAs)
w1 <- summerkill ~ long + lat + season +
  variance_after_ice_30 + variance_after_ice_60 +
  log_schmidt + cumulative_above_10 + ice_duration + water_pca

# First generalized model for air temperature
a1 <- summerkill ~ long + lat + season + air_pca + max_air
```

The second model involves all covariates except site_id, which we treat separately because of the number of levels.

```{r: Second generalized model}
# Second generalized model for water temperature (removed population for now because of NAs)
w2 <- summerkill ~ long + lat + season + ice_duration +
  variance_after_ice_30 + variance_after_ice_60 + log_schmidt +
    cumulative_above_10 + cumulative_above_5 + cumulative_above_0 + water_pca +
    max_bot + max_surf + mean_bot + mean_surf +
    max_bot_z + max_surf_z + mean_bot_z + mean_surf_z +
    layer_diff + water_quad_temp + peak_temp 

# Second generalized model for air temperature
a2 <- summerkill ~ long + lat + season +
  min_air + mean_air + max_air + 
  min_air_z + mean_air_z + max_air_z +
  air_quad_temp + air_pca
```

### Step 3: Set up parameters for lambda selection for ridge and lasso regressions

Black magic.

```{r: Set up parameters for ridge and lasso models}
# No down sampling
control_logloss <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                                number = 5,
                                repeats = 5,
                                summaryFunction = mnLogLoss,
                                classProbs = TRUE)

# Down sampling
control_logloss_ds <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                                   number = 5,
                                   repeats = 5,
                                   summaryFunction = mnLogLoss,
                                   classProbs = TRUE,
                                   sampling = "down")
```

### Step 4: Logistic regressions

First set of generalized models from above (w1 and a1).

```{r: First logistic regression}
# Set seed
set.seed(432)

# First generalized model for water temperature
logistic_w1 <- glm(w1, training, family = "binomial")

# Stepwise model comparisons by AIC
logistic_w1 <- step(logistic_w1)

# First generalized model for air temperature
logistic_a1 <- glm(a1, training, family = "binomial")

# Stepwise model comparisons by AIC
logistic_a1 <- step(logistic_a1)

# Save models
write_rds(logistic_w1, "assessment/logistic_w1.rds")
write_rds(logistic_a1, "assessment/logistic_a1.rds")
```

Second set of generalized model from above (w2 and a2).

```{r: Second logistic regression}
# Second generalized model for water temperature
logistic_w2 <- glm(w2, training, family = "binomial") 

### Warning message:
### glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred 

# Stepwise model comparisons by AIC
logistic_w2 <- step(logistic_w2)

# Second generalized model for air temperature
logistic_a2 <- glm(a2, training, family = "binomial") 

# Stepwise model comparisons by AIC
logistic_a2 <- step(logistic_a2)

# Save models
write_rds(logistic_w2, "assessment/logistic_w2.rds")
write_rds(logistic_a2, "assessment/logistic_a2.rds")
```

### Step 5: Lasso regressions

This fits LASSO models with many differenct lambdas, utilizing a 5-fold CV scheme, repeated five times, on the training data.

First set of models with logloss and without downsampling (w1 and a1). Note that this suffers from unidentifiability in lambda (from Till).
